The Braille-O-Matic is a device that allows the blind and visually impaired to read digital text by generating Braille characters at the pace at which Braille is read. The prototype was built using mbed microcontrollers- it sports Internet access, utilizes various self-built APIs, offers multiple speed options and provides a large RGB screen for education and verification purposes. The device presents a compelling value proposition for individuals hoping to keep up with the digital media at an affordable price point.
